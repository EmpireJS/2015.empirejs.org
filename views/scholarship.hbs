      <h2>EmpireJS 2015 Scholarship</h2>
      <div class="divider-inner"></div>

      <p>EmpireJS exists to educate and grow the Javascript community in New York City. We are excited to announce that we will be granting scholarships for our upcoming conference. We are constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive. What is building diversity to us? Encouraging community members from any underrepresented group in tech to attend and participate. This scholarship is open to anyone who will be in New York City on April 25th and April 26th. This is a community run event; we hope in the future we are able to provide travel and lodging, but cannot do so as part of this initiative.</p>

      <p>We hope this scholarship program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community!</p>

      <h3>Sponsor a scholarship</h3>

      <p>We’d love to be able to provide as many scholarships as possible, and we need your help! If you’re a company interested in sponsoring a scholarship, get in touch with us! Each $1000 sponsor scholarship sends 3 recipients at-cost to EmpireJS. Please contact <a href="mailto:us@empirejs.org">us@empirejs.org</a> for further details.</p>

      <h3>Diversity Enthusiast Ticket</h3>

      <p>Are you an individual wanting to help shape the future of JavaScript through a more diverse crowd? We invite you to become a Diversity Enthusiast. The purchase of this ticket ($600 USD) gets you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 EmpireJS ticket for you</li>
        <li>1 EmpireJS ticket for someone in the community who couldn’t afford to come selected via our scholarship application</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to apply to receive a scholarship</h3>

Are you an organization brimming with people who should be attending our conference but can’t swing the cost? Encourage folks to apply! The application deadline is April 1st. We will notify recipients by April 5th, and the remaining applicants will remain on a waiting list in case we are able to offer more from generous giving.
